# Copilot Instructions

## Package Management

We use `uv` for package management, not `pip`. E.g. `uv add <package-name>` or `uv sync`.

We use the Django framework for tests, not `unittest` or `pytest`. To run tests, use the Django management command `manage.py test <path-to-specific-test>`.

## Code Style

### Accessibility

We follow the [W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) and the [W3C Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/) specifications. This includes using semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and attributes, and ensuring that all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.

### Semantic Markup

We use semantic HTML markup. For example, use `<header>` instead of `<div class="header">`, and `<nav>` instead of `<div class="nav">`. This helps with accessibility and SEO. Also, use `<main>` for the main content of the page, and `<footer>` for the footer. Use `<section>` for sections of content, and `<article>` for articles or blog posts. Use `<aside>` for sidebars or related content. Use semantic headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to structure the content. Use `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for images with captions. Use `<time>` for dates and times. Use `<address>` for contact information. Also, ensure that all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers.

### CSS Styles

We're moving towards using Tailwind CSS with daisyUI components. There may be some residual Bootstrap CSS in the codebase, but we are gradually removing it. Please use Tailwind CSS and daisyUI components for new styles.

Make sure to use the Context7 tool to fetch the latest Tailwind CSS 4.x and daisyUI 5.x style rules so our styles are up to date.

### Tailwind prose

Content that uses the Wagtail `richtext` filter should be wrapped in a `prose` class. This is because we can't manually style the HTML generated by the `richtext` filter. The `prose` class will apply Tailwind CSS styles to the content, making it look good without needing to manually style each element.
